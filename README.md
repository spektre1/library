This is a technical proof of concept of a REST
API backend that manages licenses to books, and serves the books to users. This
is connected to a VR Chat world that acts as the user interface to this backend.

The world will function by providing the player an interface to the searchable
database of books. Books can be selected by a search term, keywords, categories,
and other collation methods.
