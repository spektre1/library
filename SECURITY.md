# Security Policy

This is a volunteer project, so updates will be made when possible.

From the ecosystem standpoint, we will strive to keep the dependencies in the application up to date.

From the application standpoint, security applies to the database, but not to the code.
This mostly relates to the licensure infrastructure in the application.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there's issues with the application, please report them on The 3rd Library Discord.
